# Instagram Curator Network Project

## Overview
This project builds a website to **display information scraped from Instagram** and visualize relationships between accounts. It focuses on identifying and ranking accounts based on a "curator network" model, using PageRank to determine influence within the network.

---

## Data Sources
Example data structures are provided for reference:

1. **`following_count_scrape_example.csv`**  
   - Contains the number of followers for each account.  
   - Used for follower-based filtering.

2. **`following_relationship_scrape_example.csv`**  
   - Contains relationships between accounts (who follows whom).  
   - Used to build the curator network graph.

---

## Additional Account Data
Accounts may also have:
- **Categories** — tags describing the account.
- **Descriptions** — summaries of the account or its owner.  
Both are generated by an AI model that gathers publicly available information from across the web.

##Scale and Storage
- This project is hosted in a Railway database
- It should be able to handle 100k accounts

---
## Development process
- I am an amatuer developer using github copilot on codespaces on Chrome
- I will need help maintainig best practices and making sure the codebase does not becdome bloated.

## Definitions

- **Curator Network**  
  The set of accounts that **follow other accounts** in the dataset.  
  These curators determine which accounts are highlighted and ranked.

- **Search Results**  
  The accounts that curators follow, ranked in descending order by their **PageRank score** within the network.

---

## Ranking & Filtering Rules
1. **Initial Ranking:**  
   - Show all search results ranked by **PageRank** calculated from the curator network.

2. **Dynamic Ranking:**  
   - When one or more curator accounts are **selected**, recalculate rankings based only on their following relationships.

3. **Keyword Search:**  
   - Search fields allow filtering results by matching **categories** or **descriptions**.

4. **Follower Filter:**  
   - Allow filtering accounts by a **minimum and/or maximum follower count**.

## AI Agent Guidelines
When contributing or generating code:
- Maintain **data schema compatibility** with provided CSV examples.
- Preserve **PageRank ordering logic** as the core ranking mechanism.
- Ensure the site updates **dynamically** when curator selections change.
- Implement **efficient search & filter functions** for categories, descriptions, and follower counts.
- Keep the UI minimal but clear:  
  - Curator network at the top  
  - Search results below in ranked order  
- Avoid breaking existing data import and parsing logic.
